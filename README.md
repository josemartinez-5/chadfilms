## What is Chadfilms?
Chadfilms is a film store website where the users can add films to a shopping cart, "buy" them, check their purchases, "watch" the films bought and leave comments about the films.
There's also some examples of the implementation of CRUD, using some of the website database tables, under the section `Prácticas (Sección de administrador)`, on the sidebar.

## Demo
Unfortunately, at the moment, I cannot afford to deploy this project on a public server.
